A basic structure to hold country and state info for web pages. The information is derived from a yaml file.

* countries.yaml
* countries.py
* countries.js

I've also arranged the info as an Array only in

* country_state.py
* country_state.js

If you notice something out of place for your country then please feel free to fix it.  All I asl is you leave any comments in the source files if you use them.
