A basic structure to hold country and state info in a yaml file. This can easily be converted to JSON or Python.

* countries.yaml
* countries.py
* countries.js

I've also arranged the info as an Array only in.

* country_state.py
* country_state.js

If you notice something out of place for your country then please feel free to fix it. Hopefully you can use this to repidly develop web forms that display country and state information.
